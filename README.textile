Flexible Admin is a Rails 3.1 Admin tool to generate an attractive data admin to handle login, data CRUD, search and sort while leaving an easy way to customize the particular needs of an apps custom admin functions.

h4. Distinctions from other Rails admin gems

Flexible admin generates controller and view files for every model that you are managing, then invites you to get your hands dirty for the customizations of the admin

# Can-can for managing who can edit what
# Devise for login
# Bootstrap for style
# inherited_resources for rest controllers
# Database Tables (js) for table searching and sorting

h2. Getting Started

In your Gemfile

<code>gem 'flexible_admin'</code>

run <code>bundle install</code>

run <code>rails generate flexible_admin:install</code>

run <code>rake db:migrate</code> to create admin_users tables

h2. Adding models

run <code>rails generate flexible_admin Post</code> to generate a admin/posts controller, /admin/posts route, and add Posts to the admin navigation

h2. Editing views

h3. Dashboard

You can (and should) edit the /admin view at app/views/admin/index.html

h3. Sidebar

Every view file does or can have a <code>content_for :sidebar</code> block where you can content for the sidebar

h3. Custom views

Basic admin views are generated for each model so that you can directly edit them

h2. Testing

Flexible Admin as a gem is tested with rspec.  The specs cover that the generator generates the right files.  It does not test that you can actually admin in anything after the generator runs.

h3. Generates cucumber features

Flexible Admin generates cucumber features for your app that can test that the app really does do the basic admin functions.
